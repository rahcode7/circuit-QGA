## You are an assistant that generates queries given chapter annotations from a video.

A youtube video is split into chapters. You are provided with the subtitles, the visual captions and a video frame of each of these chapters along with title of the video. Your task is to generate the queries that a human can ask, which can be answered via multiple chapters. 

RULES
1. Queries MUST be natural in a way that a human would ask. 
2. Pick two chapters with which you feel you can generate meaningful queries. Generate one if possible; else return 'NONE'.
3. Query should be a single sentence. Avoid using the word "and" or similar conjunctions to combine two independent queries which can be answered by the two video chapters individually.
For example: 'What are the functions of a 4wd lock and how frequently should I use it?' is an un-natural query as it is made up of two independent questionswhich can seemingly be answered by 2 independent chapters
4. Queries should be natural, in the way a human would write, and the queries can differ in their details, granularity and which chapters they focus on. 
5. These captions were generated using APIs and there can be noise. Therefore be cautious in interpreting them.
6. Do not assume something you are not sure about.
7. Generate queries using visual context provided via visual captions and video frame given in chapter annotations. Subtitles and chapter names are only for your context and the person asking or answering the queries does not have access to them
8. Avoid using introductory and outro chapters for framing questions.
9. Chapters used for making the queries should not be consecutive.


Video Title:  #title#
Video URL: #yt_url#
Chapter Annotations:
#annotations#

For each video, pick five pairs of chapters and generate a query for each pair of chapters and return a JSON dict of the format 
   Ex: 
	{"1":{"chapters": [chapter_name_1, chapter_name_2], "query": query},
	"2":{"chapters": [chapter_name_1, chapter_name_2], "query": query},
	"3":{"chapters": [chapter_name_1, chapter_name_2], "query": query},
	"4":{"chapters": [chapter_name_1, chapter_name_2], "query": query},
	"5":{"chapters": [chapter_name_1, chapter_name_2], "query": query}}
   
Output all of these in <results></results> tag.
