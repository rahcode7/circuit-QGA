The Budget 85mm Options: Canon RF 85mm f2 Macro IS STM vs Canon EF 85mm f1.8: Is RF worth double?	chapter annotations\nchapter name: Intro\nvisual captions: The video shows a man with a blue shirt and glasses speaking into a camera, possibly during an online video tutorial. He is holding a DSLR camera in his hand as he talks about the features and uses of the product. The camera is placed in front of him on a table with several other items around it, such as a laptop and other books and papers. There are also lights in the room which create a festive atmosphere.\nsubtitles: hey guys so today we're going to talk about the two cheapest options on both of canon's full-frame mirrorless mounts on one side we have the over 30 year old ef 85 millimeter f 1.8 and then the other side we have the less than a year old rf 85 millimeter f2 macro is stm and as you can maybe tell from the names the older ef version lacks all of the features and extras that the rf version has the rf version does have a lot of features in it and it also has the new rf design which means that there's at least the potential for a lot of upgrades in sharpness and image quality but today we're going to look at the differences between the two c is the rf version really worth twice the price of the ef version and also talk about which one might be right for you\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/yi4PhhS3cbc/yi4PhhS3cbc/1.png\n\nchapter name: Build Quality & Ergonomics\nvisual captions: A man is speaking into a blue-tinted video cam, giving instructions to his audience about photography and the different types of lenses. He is wearing blue-colored sunglasses and has a beard. The camera is placed in front of him on a table. The video captures the man as he explains the importance of different types of lenses and the role they play in photography.\nsubtitles: so as far as build quality and handling goes they're both relatively small and light for 85 millimeter primes the ef is definitely smaller and lighter but you have to take into account that if you're shooting on an rf mount camera then with the ef you are going to have to use the adapter and that's going to bring them to about the same size and close to the same weight anyway neither of these lenses come with a lens hood and neither of them have weather sealing as far as what we have on the lenses themselves the rf has kind of a lot of controls on it so it has the control ring that rf lenses has it has the focus ring it has three switches one for choosing between auto focus and manual focus one for turning the image stabilization on and off and one to control the focus limiter on the lens we can choose between the full focusing distance only the macro focusing distances and everything but the macro focusing distances on here the ef on the other hand is very bare bones it has focusing ring a built-in focus distance meter on the lens rf lenses don't have this because when you're manually focusing with rf lenses you can see the distance meter in your display and then of course the ef lens also has a switch to choose between auto focus and manual focus ergonomically the ef lens really is not bad at all to use however the rf85 is one of my favorite lenses ergonomically\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/yi4PhhS3cbc/yi4PhhS3cbc/2.png\n\nchapter name: Photography\nvisual captions: In the video a young male is wearing glasses while giving a video tutorial on how to use a camera. He is standing in a room, possibly his own, and talking to the camera. The room has various objects like a book, a cup, and a laptop. The camera used in the video is placed on a tripod.\nsubtitles: so when it comes to photography the 85 millimeter focal length is the standard go-to for portraits and if that's what you're trying to use these lenses for both of them are going to do really well image quality color reproduction is great on both as far as sharpness goes i will say the rf comes out ahead here the ef version it's good i shot these images that you see here on the r6 and i didn't sharpen anything in post and i would say the ef is just barely not able to keep up with the 20 megapixels of the r6 and it's not bad like i said you can easily add a little bit of sharpening in post if you want to you really can only tell if you're zooming in on these images and it's definitely usable add some sharpening in post and it'll look great but the rf lens is going to be sharper right out of the gate without any sharpness boosts in post so let's talk about minimum focus distance which on the ef lens is 2.14 feet or 0.85 meter the rf version has 2 1 macro so it can actually focus at 1.14 feet or 0.35 meter and that's about a third of the minimum focus distance of the ef version and this is definitely a huge difference with the ef version that's a pretty far minimum focus distance and it can be a hindrance in some instances whereas with the rf in typical shooting conditions you're not going to be running too close to your subject to get it in focus and i think this rf lens can really function as the macro lens for a lot of people that aren't dedicated macro photographers outside of macro situations they both focus really fast and i will say that the rf version in photography seems to be a little faster a little more confident but it's also several decades newer than the ef version so that would kind of be expected and of course the rf lens has optical image stabilization and i will say image stabilization in an 85 millimeter lens is not strictly necessary and hand holding you're not really going to or even on a tripod that's not really going to help you in low light situations unless you're shooting completely stationary subjects otherwise your subjects are going to be blurred because your shutter speed is too low so it's not necessarily again something that you have to have in an 85 millimeter lens now as far as the maximum aperture on these lenses f2 versus f 1.8 first of all there's not a huge difference especially if you're talking just about bokeh i think that the f2 lens can easily get good bokeh and blur out the background especially at 85 millimeters that's not really a huge deal light transmission is a little bit worse on the rf lens even when you're shooting at the exact same settings between the two lenses the rf lens tends to expose about a third of a stop darker than the ef lens now that's not a big deal low light performance will be a little bit worse but with how well the r series cameras do in low light i don't think that's really going to be a problem that most people are going to find as a hindrance so if you're a photographer looking for a budget 85 millimeter lens i don't think the ef version is necessarily a bad option if you're really on a tight budget but if you can stretch that budget a little bit and make the rf lens work i think you're going to be more happy with the image quality and the resolution power of that lens and also just the extra features that it has\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/yi4PhhS3cbc/yi4PhhS3cbc/3.png\n\nchapter name: Video\nvisual captions: The man with a beard is wearing blue jeans as he sits at a dining table in his living room, sipping coffee and talking to the camera. His hand is holding the coffee cup, and he is smiling. He appears to be engaged in a video chat with a friend. The camera is placed close to him, focusing on his facial expressions and actions.\nsubtitles: so now when we get to video it's a different comparison completely and i will say first of all they both have good image quality and video i would prefer the image quality of the rf lens again it's a little bit sharper a little bit crisper and you would think that because the rf lens has image stabilization built into the lens at 85 millimeters that that's going to be a hands-down winner the problem here is that the autofocus performance in video on the rf 85 millimeter lens is absolutely terrible and even the manual focusing in video is really bad and clunky which basically means that the rf lens is useless in video so i will say with the ef lens again you don't have optical image stabilization in the lens now with the r6 and the r5 that now have in-body image stabilization you can still use that for certain situations hand-held and get away with it and it'll still look pretty good so if video is a component at all i would say it's not even a competition here it's the ef lens and it's just because the video autofocus on this rf lens is completely unusable and makes the rf lens not a usable option for video\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/yi4PhhS3cbc/yi4PhhS3cbc/4.png\n\nchapter name: For Whom is it Right\nvisual captions: A male photographer is standing in front of a backdrop of lights with two camera lenses in his hands. The camera lenses are the Canon 11-24mm and the Canon 16-35mm. He is examining and comparing the two lenses while talking to the camera, expressing his opinions on the features and quality. He is also adjusting the focusing ring on one of the lenses, possibly to showcase the focusing capabilities of the camera. This is a demonstration of the two different camera lenses, highlighting their features and functionality to the camera owner.\nsubtitles: so which lens is right for you i will say if your photographer if you can make that budget work and stretch it to get to the rf lens i think it's a much better option not that the ef is a bad option but the difference in image quality and all of the extra features that you get i think it's just a much better value for a photographer however if video is an option even if you're a hybrid shooter that wants to use this lens for video and photo i don't think the rf lens can be considered an option because of the terrible performance both in auto focus and manual focus with this lens it's just not usable for video at all even though the image quality on the rf lens in video is actually really good and again the image stabilization is really good it just can't be used the way that it is right now maybe a firmware update in the future will help fix that but i haven't heard anything about such a firmware update coming out at any point so anyway that was my thoughts i hope that it helped you if you're looking into either of those lenses if you like this video give it a thumbs up let me know in the comments are you looking at these two lenses what do you think which one of you may be leaning towards and why if you are interested in purchasing either of those lenses or any of the other gear that i've mentioned in this video i'll leave affiliate links in the description below if you purchase through those links at no extra cost to you it'll help support this channel so that i can continue making videos for you guys if you haven't yet hit the subscribe button see you\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/yi4PhhS3cbc/yi4PhhS3cbc/5.png\n\n	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi4PhhS3cbc

Marriage is just one of those things. These single stars and couples haven't gone\ndown the aisle, and that's just fine with them. Why Oprah won't marry Stedman Oprah Winfrey and her longtime boyfriend Stedman\nGraham have been together since 1986. And, as she revealed on an episode of Super\nSoul Sunday, Graham even proposed to her once, but she didn't say yes. ""The moment he asked me to marry him, I was\nlike, ""Ooooh, God."" Now I actually have to get married?"" In 2012, the actress and media mogul explained\nto NDTV why she didn't want to tie the proverbial knot: ""I never got married because I live in a country\nand a culture that allows me to have the choice. Still wondering why Oprah won't walk down\nthe aisle? She'll happily spell it out for you: ""I really am my own woman and I don't really\nconform very well to other people's ideas.

In 2016, he told Parade: ""That time will come when that time comes. The truth is, you can't predict marriage. You can't plan it. It's just going to happen when it happens."" Of course, marriage might happen when he finally\ndecides on just one swimsuit model for the long haul. In 2014, he told MSS Magazine: ""I think everybody, not everybody, but I think\nthat eventually when the time is right...Absolutely, yeah.""

The woman is also holding a pen, possibly preparing to take notes during the interview.\nsubtitles: and Theron reportedly isn't too keen on marriage. Sharing her views on marriage equality in\n2011, she told PIers Morgan Tonight: ""I'll be the first to say, here on your show,\nmarriage, before I felt this way about this issue, was never something that was important."" She had a change of heart in December 2014\nwhen she got engaged to Sean Penn after a year of dating, but they split six months\nlater. Their breakup was reportedly rather contentious,\nso who knows if she'll ever want to walk down the aisle now? Sounds like: Probably not.

In 1991, Hawn was more than happy to explain\nthe reason why to Oprah: ""If you leave the door open, you'll never\nwalk out of it. Sometimes if you close the door and there's\na sense of finality, that, a lot of things happen to people."" Sounds like she's not exactly a big fan of\nlavish wedding ceremonies, either: ""This whole thing of spending millions and\nthousands or whatever these people spend on their weddings … I just think I'd rather\ntake that money and give it to abused children.""

She put it another way during an appearance\non The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2002: ""People tend to treat you as a couple, and\nyou lose your individuality, and there's something great about knowing that when you wake up\nin the morning, you're there because you've chosen to be there.""

How to Use Your Laptop as a Teleprompter	chapter annotations\nchapter name: Items You'll Need to Set Your Laptop Up as Teleprompter\nvisual captions: A woman walks through a small living space with a camera in hand, pointing it towards the various items and furniture around the room. She pans across the space and zooms in and out of various objects, capturing the details of the room's decor. She also moves closer to the camera to get a better view of some areas, and then moves away to get a wider perspective of the living room.\nsubtitles: To use a laptop as a teleprompter, here's\nwhat you'll need to get started: You'll need a laptop loaded with a word processing\nprogram. We use Microsoft Word for our scripted videos. A wireless mouse. We use a Logitech M505 mouse. We like this mouse because it's got a good\nscroll wheel and performs well even when located up to 25 feet away from the laptop. Your video camera, preferably on a tripod. For scripted videos, we found it's better\nto use a tripod for a stable shot and to adjust the camera height as needed. A stable surface to put your laptop on -- such\nas a table, stand or bookcase. For our videos, we use a bookcase because\nthe shelves allow us to adjust the laptop's placement, giving us just the right angle\nfor our speaker reading the script. Once you have these items, there are 4 simple\nsteps to setting up your laptop to work as a teleprompter.\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/ybyCb7SK-EA/ybyCb7SK-EA/1.png\n\nchapter name: STEP 1  Prepare your script: Write your script using your word processing program. Once you're happy with the script, increase the point size of the text and adjust the margins so that you can read the text from a distance\nvisual captions: In the video, a woman is sitting in a room and using a laptop to type. A man appears in the scene, standing next to her. The laptop is open, and the woman seems to be working intently. The man stands in the background, observing her and possibly assisting with her work. The atmosphere in the room seems focused and productive.\nsubtitles: Step 1: You need to prepare your script in\nyour word processing program. In Microsoft Word, we set the font to Arial\nBold, 36 points. We use Print Layout view and 1/2-inch margins\nall the way around. Depending on how far away your speaker will\nbe from the laptop, you may need to adjust your margins and font size accordingly.\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/ybyCb7SK-EA/ybyCb7SK-EA/2.png\n\nchapter name: STEP 2    Set up your video camera on your tripod. You want to set up your tripod at just the right height and angle so that your speaker appears to be looking straight into the video camera lens\nvisual captions: In the video, a woman is seen sitting in the foreground of her apartment, talking to the camera. She is discussing the process of setting up a camera for trolling. She explains the first step is to set up the camera on a tripod and then to adjust the camera's settings for the best view.\n\nAfter the woman finishes her explanation about the first step, she demonstrates by adjusting the camera on her tripod to a better position. The camera appears to be placed on a table, possibly on the floor as well, to achieve the desired height. Once the camera is adjusted, the woman moves the camera around, showing the view from different angles.\n\nThe woman continues to explain the second step, which involves recording a test video using the camera and adjusting the camera settings based on the quality of the video. She demonstrates this by recording a short video with the camera, showing the view from various angles and zoom levels.\n\nAfter the second step, the woman returns to the camera and discusses the third step, which involves reviewing the recorded video. She explains the importance of reviewing the video and making adjustments to achieve the best possible results.\n\nTo conclude her talk, the woman emphasizes the importance of setting up the camera properly and taking time to review and adjust the settings to ensure the desired outcome.\nsubtitles: Step 2: You need to set up your video camera\non your tripod. You want to set up your tripod at just the\nright height and angle so that your subject appears to be looking straight into the camera's\nlens.\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/ybyCb7SK-EA/ybyCb7SK-EA/3.png\n\nchapter name: STEP 3   Set up your laptop on a stable surface near your video camera. Position your laptop near your video camera at a height so that it appears your speaker is looking at the camera while reading the text scrolling on the laptop. This step can be a little tricky, so be prepared to try a few setups with the tripod, video camera and laptop to achieve the right angle and height\nvisual captions: The video starts with an older woman sitting at a desk in a room, talking into a laptop camera. She is using the device as a microphone and appears to be recording a message or a video. The woman is wearing a purple jacket and appears focused while talking into the camera.\nsubtitles: Step 3: Set up your laptop on a stable surface\nnear your camera. One option is to place the laptop very close\nto your camera at approximately the same height either to the left or right side of the camera. Another option which we use for our videos\nis to place the laptop behind the camera at a height slightly above the top edge of the\ncamera. This allows the speaker to read the laptop\nscreen without the camera blocking the view. We use a bookcase that works perfect for this. The effect you're going for is that when your\nspeaker is reading the script from the laptop, it appears that he or she is looking right\nat the camera and not reading at all. What you don't want is for your speaker to\nappear looking at a point beside the camera or well above the camera as this will give\nyour speaker a distracted, unnatural look.\nIMAGE:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceyxasm/vid-frames-dv1-p7/master/ybyCb7SK-EA/ybyCb7SK-EA/4.png\n\nchapter name: STEP 4    Practice before filming. Ideally, the speaker should be the one to scroll the script using the wireless mouse. This way he can match the speed of the scroll to his reading. You'll find with a wireless mouse you don't need to have the mouse on a surface for the scroll feature to work. You can hold the mouse to your side and operate the scroll wheel to go through the script from beginning to end\nvisual captions: In the video, a female adult is sitting in a chair with her laptop on her lap. She is wearing glasses and has two dogs sitting beside her on the floor. She appears to be watching a movie, as there are several DVDs scattered around her chair. The scene is set in a living room or office, with a book placed on a table nearby. A cell phone is visible, possibly belonging to one of the dogs.\nsubtitles: Step 4: Practice before filming. Have your speaker practice scrolling the script\nso that he can match the speed of the scroll to his reading. You'll find with a wireless mouse you don't\nneed to have the mouse on a surface for the scroll feature to work. For example, here you can see I'm scrolling\nthe script on my laptop right now while I'm reading the script. I usually just hold the mouse down by my side\nout of the camera shot and this works just fine. Next, you'll need to do one last confirmation\nthat your camera and laptop setup are correct. Shoot a minute's worth of test footage and\nplay it back to see if it looks natural. If it doesn't, keep adjusting the camera height\nand the placement of the laptop until you get the effect you want. So there you have it, our tip on how to use\nyour laptop as a teleprompter.
